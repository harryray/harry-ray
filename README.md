# Harry Ray - Portfolio

There's most likely going to be a range of sites and languages actually in here, as I'm fairly restless when it comes to personal projects, and always like to have something to work on. Look around!

## `portfolio-gatsby`

This is the Gatsby portion of my portfolio, containing a homepage, contact info and a basic personal site. Built with Gatsby and deployed through Netlify.

## `portfolio-jekyll`

This is the Jekyll portion of my portfolio. Built with Jekyll, deployed through Github Pages.
