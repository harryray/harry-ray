======

There's most likely going to be a range of sites and languages actually in here, as I'm fairly restless when it comes to personal projects, and always like to have something to work on. Look around!

This hub is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages, using the standard Jekyll 'Minimal' theme. For a bit of a deeper dive into Jekyll and what it can do, please check the [`portfolio-jekyll`](https://priceless-neumann-f7cdcd.netlify.com/) section.

## [`portfolio-gatsby`](https://eloquent-dubinsky-2dfdf3.netlify.com/)

This is the Gatsby portion of my portfolio, containing a homepage, contact info and a basic personal site. Built with Gatsby and deployed through Netlify.

## [`portfolio-jekyll`](https://priceless-neumann-f7cdcd.netlify.com/)

This is the Jekyll portion of my portfolio. Built with Jekyll, deployed through Github Pages. A deeper dive than this home hub, exploring more hands-on and bespoke coding work and some under-the-hood alterations to Jekyll, and the standard Jekyll themes.
